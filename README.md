### Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the world of business sales analysis. Our journey begins in the project folders, where we encounter well-organized raw and processed data within the "data" folder. To enhance our analytical capabilities, we have curated a dedicated "features" folder containing several functions primarily designed for data visualization.

### Analysis Approach - Descriptive

Our analysis approach primarily focuses on descriptive analytics. This analysis aims to understand the historical sales data and identify trends, patterns, and relationships within the data. Using statistical methods, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis techniques, we will extract valuable insights to answer high-level business questions and provide a comprehensive view of sales performance and behavior.

Through descriptive analysis, we will uncover critical metrics such as total revenue, sales by city category, monthly sales trends, best-performing products, and customer purchasing behavior. By visualizing the data and generating meaningful reports, we will facilitate informed decision-making and identify opportunities for business improvement.
